# CAR PRICE PREDICTION ML PROJECT
**📌 Project Overview**
This project predicts the price of cars based on different features such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, horsepower, and other specifications. The goal is to demonstrate how Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, can be applied to real-world datasets for predictive modeling.


**🎯 Objectives**
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict car prices.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Handle data preprocessing: missing values, encoding, and scaling.
- Evaluate model performance using regression metrics.


**🛠️ Tech Stack**
- Programming Language: Python 🐍
- Libraries & Tools:
- Pandas, NumPy → Data Handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization
- Scikit-learn → Linear Regression, Model Evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


**📊 Workflow**
- Data Collection – Load car dataset (CSV).
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, categorical encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize relationships (e.g., price vs mileage, horsepower, fuel type).
- Feature Selection – Identify significant features for car price prediction.
- Model Building – Apply Linear Regression.
- Model Evaluation – Use R², MSE, RMSE to evaluate performance.
- Prediction – Predict prices for new/unseen car data.
- Streamlit - for deployment
